<h2>Climate collapse is knocking on our door, and most of us know that something must be done to change the system that continues to destroy our home.</h2>

<p>History has repeatedly shown that to win the biggest battles for systematic social change it takes massive collaboration and commitment.
This time itâ€™s a matter of life or death on this planet and action is needed ASAP.</p>

<p>To defeat our catastrophic climate collapse and horrific species extinction trajectories it will take lots more than big protests.</p>

<p>This will take courage. However, without brilliant organization these seeds for change are likely to go to waste.</p>

<p>Grassroots organisations have given us hope in the power of people organising. They have shown us that we CAN come together to make waves and have our voices heard. To speak on behalf of all beings and the planet.</p>

<p>We saw that the current momentum was not matching the urgency for change, so we created GetCourageNow.</p>

<p>GetCourageNow is a one stop app that provides you with a secure, open source, self organising collaboration & news system for Climate Change campaigning. We can help you fight in the most important battle of our time.</p>
