## We help organizations fighting climate bullies to recruit the millions of people needed to join the fight and give us a better chance of creating serious change. We give people like you more ways and reasons to get involved and save the planet. 

**Pondering whether to sign up to a strike or a nonviolent direct action, but not quite ready to commit? _No Problem!_** 

WinWisely will: 

- Show you all of the campaigns happening in your area

- Track the amount of people willing to commit to action and the numbers needed to have a 30%, 50% or 70-80% chance of success

- Offer you up to 20 ways you can support a campaign in addition to being a frontline resistor

- Provide you with the support you need to get involved 

- Help you connect with other like-minded activists and supporters in your area  

- Keep you in the loop with community meetings and nonviolent direct action trainings

- Provide you with a secure networking platform to chat, support, plan, and organize
