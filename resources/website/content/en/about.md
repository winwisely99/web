GetCourageNow is a one stop app that provides you with a secure, open source, self organising collaboration & news system for Climate Change campaigning. 

We use simple recruitment strategies, proven psychological motivators, and easy to use collaboration and communication tools to increase civic engagement and elevate the voice of the collective. We do this because we care about the fate of our planet and all beings that call it home.

### The key principles behind GetCourageNow are::

- Solution and Efficiency Focussed: Based on the research of Erica Chenoweth and Maria Stephan, we believe that coming together as a united collective is now the best option we have of saving the planet. However this will require more advanced organising technology to recruit, commit, organise, and support such a movement. That’s where we come in.

- One-Stop Shop: GetCourageNow makes it easy for anyone seeking a progressive solution to find the campaign and action or role that best fits their capacities, skills, limitations, and other preferences.

- Based on Sound Tactics and Advanced Tech: All the components of our app have been carefully thought out by our talented team to give users the best experience and increase the success of climate campaigns.


- Free: Anyone can use these services to get involved and help save the planet.   

- Secure: GetCourageNow will serve as a platform for advancing TLS security best practices. All user data and communication through the app will be stored securely on the user’s devices.

- Open: The automatic issuance and renewal protocol will be published as an open standard that others can adopt. 

- Cooperative: We work with campaign partners to ensure the best possible outcomes for climate campaigns and their supporters.
